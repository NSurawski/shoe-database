## Project

I am going to make a website for a shoe database for shoe collectors. Users can create a profile and add shoes to their collection. Users will be able to add, update and delete different shoe entries. Users will be able to access their entire personal shoe library

##  Planning and Process

I started this project by creating my ERD and figuring out what the relationship between users and shoes would be; I decided that it would be a one to many - one user to many shoes. I started thinking about the attributes I wanted my resource to have. I knew there would be certain attributes that would be important to the user, brand, style and type. After creating the ERD and initial planning, I downloaded my templates and got my project files set up; after creating any additional folders/files needed, I added all of my require statements to ensure files were properly linked, referring to previous lessons to ensure proper placement and syntax.

Once my files were set up, I was ready to start coding for my API.  I added the shoe attributes to my shoe Schema and set up my routes. I did not have as many issues with my API file as I did with my client one. I was able to get Auth and CRUD actions working successfully in my terminal using my Curl scripts. I was only having issues with certain CRUD commands in my browser/client facing website.
