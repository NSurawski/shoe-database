## Project

I am going to make a website for a shoe database for shoe collectors. Users can create a profile and add shoes to their collection. Users will be able to add, update and delete different shoe entries. Users will be able to access their entire personal show library

## User Stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.
